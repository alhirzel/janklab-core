Contributing to Janklab
========================

Janklab is largely a personal project, not a community one, so I'm not looking for major contributions or PRs.

Bug reports and feature requests are welcome. Please post them as Issues on the GitHub Issue Tracker for this project. You can also contact me by email.

Check with me first before writing code for a PR. Since I'm conservative about accepting them, I wouldn't want you to waste your time writing code that won't be used.
